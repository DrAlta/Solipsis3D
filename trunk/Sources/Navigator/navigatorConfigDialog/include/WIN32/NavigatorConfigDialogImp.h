		interacts with the user independently. The dialog will be
		calling the relevant OGRE rendering systems to query them for
		options and to set the options the user selects. The method
		returns when the user closes the dialog.
	@returns
		If the user accepted the dialog, <b>true</b> is returned.
	@par
		If the user cancelled the dialog (indicating the application
		should probably terminate), <b>false</b> is returned.
