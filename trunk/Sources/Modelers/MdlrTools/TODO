TODO LIST for Solipsis tools : 
	- Fix compilation time
	- Replace the material -> noDepthMaterial for the rotation axes
	- Change Guizmos size 
	- Change the bounding box : must follow the orientation of the 3D object
	- The bounding box size isn' modifed by the scale transformation ??? must add a rotation after ???
	- Add comments to the headers MII & Tools for doxygen (brief ...)

	- SOLID* solidA, solidB;    (hole of memory) destroy the 2 pointers after the deformation has been applied
	- DIMPLE / PATH_CUT / HOLE : generate the normals of SBO::OutputSolid(...)
	  ... possibility to create some copies of vertexes to not have a smoothed volume (not 100% smooth)
	
	- HALF_SHPERE/CONE : verify between PATH_CUT & DIMPLE at the creation of a half_object
	- apply the last deformation when we close the properties frame (ref saveFile !!)
	- replace the 'TUBE' by a cylinder and apply a 'HOLE+HOLLOW_SHAPE_CIRCLE' on it !!!
	- UNDO & BOUNDINGBOX : the bounding box is not well reinitialized sometimes
	- Object3D : replace some function from public to private ...
	- TRANSFORMATIONS & Children : apply the same update for the childs after a mSelection->move/rotate/scale
			Object3D *obj = mSelection->getFirstSelectedObject();	
			mii->upDateCommand(Object3D::SCALE, obj);
			obj->apply(Object3D::SCALE, mTransfo.x + 1, mTransfo.y + 1, mTransfo.z + 1 );
