[All]




[MdlrTools]
- scale updates on avatar texture not saved/seen by other avatar (+other avatar loose its connection)
- Manage a full undo function
- Rebuild correctly primitive's normals and UV maps coords when applying a transformation	

[Navigator]
- migrate XML datas from .sof, .sif into the Xml entity descriptor, updates will be simpler,
  only binary datas files are zipped into .s*f like textures, mesh, skeleton, shaders, ...
- entity datas panel (object panel attributes moved into this new panel)

- sometimes crash on resize window on login panel

- if Peer cannot connect to RakNetServer, the login XMLRPC method returned OK but no evt are sent ...,
so no error is displayed -> Nav-Peer cnx should be asynchronous with 1 CNX_ACCEPTED message

- add 1 version test when connecting to RakNetServer to detect compatibility problems requiring updates

- VLCPlugin : add support of 24bpp render, add libamem_plugin to play audio with FMod in 3D

- To fix : pref.js causes crash at first loading after a full clean

- llmozlib crash when 1 ogre exception (eg. filenotfound on texture loading in NavigatorGUI::modelerPropTextureAdd) is caught
  with 1 scene with 1 Navi object

- strange behaviour with the HTML tag <select/>, Navi author suggests to use the ComboBox class of Navi.js
  + get last Navi SVN commit

- in Mozilla plugin config
 - without NPPVpluginKeepLibraryInMemory, then Ogre Root is destroyed on each
   instance release but RenderSystem_Direct3D9_d cannot be re-loaded on next instance run
=> to debug
 - NavigatorModule Ogre MT-safe to manage by mutex when several instances are used by plugins (Ax or Moz)

- create 1 Navigator Displayer ActiveX/Plugin to interact with Navigator from 1 simple Win Mozilla browser
+ implement object-oriented interfaces NavigatorModule which would be the generic Navigator interface
  shared by different Navigator implementations : Binary application with 1 main(), Mozilla plugin, ActiveX IE, ...
   events (application, keyboard, mouse, ...) class (OIS, ...)
   all datas Navigator is waiting for (Window class, ...)
=> pb in VC7 & VC8 when loading Mozilla DLLs from Navigator DLL plugin loaded by Mozilla binary !!!
   mozilla/widget/src/windows/nstoolkit.cpp void 
nsToolkit::Startup(HMODULE hModule)
 function return error
   it is due to WNDCLASSW registration (wc.lpszClassName    = L"nsToolkitClass";) which was already registered
   by the Mozilla running instance
=> soluce should be to rename this className to avoid conflict
=> after 1 workaround about className pb, still problems on 1st Navi Web Browser creation
   in VC7 & VC8 configs (Debug & Release config)
=> ?

=> ActiveX assert on Navi update() grabWindow() in Debug config
=> ActiveX is working in Release config but fails on 2nd Navi (onPageLoaded callback not triggered)
=> Mozilla plugin is working with Navigator.dll (NavigatorModule) in Release config but fails on 1st Navi (onPageLoaded callback not triggered)

- integration of ODE and OgreOde : add 1 space for user avatar's geoms to avoid internal collisions mgt
- integration of ODE and OgreOde : sampling of mvt instead of frameTime is OK but some pb on gravity/feet/floor

- salamandra export pb with lexiExporter on root bone position offset (OK on oFusion),
  but oFusion has sometimes pbs with bounding box computation

- add methods to get position around avatar according to TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER
  with bbox + scale taken into account
- add parameter (0..1)*MAX_SPEED for transition between Walk and Run anims
- add blending between previous and next animations
- 1 Run Key ? or Always run ?

- debug of DirectX device restore -> Ogre violation exception on restore

- Add 1 plugin PeersSceneManager to manage Solipsis Node datas (mesh, materials, anims)
  + description per LOD

- Add 1 dedicated thread to load contents to avoid user movements locks

- Alpha component on Navi windows in OpenGL config

- Linux: compilation of Mozilla/XULrunner from release 1.8.1
(CVS repository from co_FIREFOX_2_0_RELEASE.bat)
(branch FIREFOX_2_0_RELEASE)
=> pb patch not compatible with 1.8.1 but with 1.5.0.12 => try with 1.5.0.12
- Linux: compilation of LLMozLib
- Linux: compilation of Navi/NaviDemo
=> compilation OK but black screen ! (maybe opengl)

- add progress bar for scene download (Tof)
- add progress bar for object download (Tof)
- add progress bar for avatar download (Tof)
- add progress bar for object upload (Tof)

-Replace NAVI with awesomium

- add scriptin feature for objects (Olivier)
