- Win: compilation of Mozilla/XULrunner from release 1.8.04
(from mozilla FTP xulrunner-1.8.0.4-source.tar.bz2)
- Win: compilation of LLMozLib vc7 & vc8
- Win: compilation of Navi/NaviDemo vc7 & vc8

- Win: compilation of Mozilla/XULrunner from release 1.8.1
(CVS repository from co_FIREFOX_2_0_RELEASE.bat)
(branch FIREFOX_2_0_RELEASE)
- Win: compilation of LLMozLib vc7 & vc8
- Win: compilation of Navi/NaviDemo vc7 & vc8

- Win: compilation of SVN Ogre on vc8
=> Dependencies directory to replace + include and lib directories to remove

- Win: install solipsis (prebuit OK + sources OK)

- Win: compilation of SVN Solipsis Navigator + Tests

- Win: replacement of CEGUI user interfaces by HTML/CSS under Navi library
into Navigator project
- Win: add pthread support (Dependencies\pthread) to implement
the peer events listener (Win32/Linux portable)

- Move dependencies LLMozLib + Navi into Solipsis/Dependencies

- Add 1 option about HTTP proxy into options panel
- Replace into options about HTTP proxy 1 panel with 1 tabs

- pb on station spatiale scene : no lights impact => due to node scaling, normals are scaled too !

- Move navigator/bin/Debug&Release into Common/bin/Debug&Release

- get Ogre 1.4.4 + rebuild

- fluidity improvements + keys/mouse management to update
- 1 global Solipsis solution
- add shadows
=> hmhm ok but fps-- + shadow texture too big and shadow on avatar too small

- update with Navi 1.4

- integration of salamandra
 facing X axis -> OK
 all anims in same .max -> OK (with lexiExporter and oFusion with some BBox troubles)
 scale pb: x40 by OGRE -> OK resolved with Nel Plugin

- tune the camera according to avatar size (waiting salamandra with good local axes ...)
- integration of ODE and OgreOde
- integration of ODE and OgreOde : ray floor OK, capsule geom OK, sphere gravity floor OK
- integration of ODE and OgreOde : VC7 projects

- integration of LUA

- add small refresh rate on focused navi in order to display blinking cursor
- add 3D picking on Navis (refer to ogreaddons\uOgreBrowser)
=> still 1 small problem when the ray origin is into the AABB of the navi

- create 1 Navigator Displayer ActiveX/Plugin to interact with Navigator from 1 simple Win Mozilla browser
+ implement object-oriented interfaces NavigatorModule which would be the generic Navigator interface
  shared by different Navigator implementations : Binary application with 1 main(), Mozilla plugin, ActiveX IE, ...
   events (application, keyboard, mouse, ...) class (OIS, ...)
   all datas Navigator is waiting for (Window class, ...)
=> pb when loading Mozilla DLLs from Navigator DLL plugin loaded by Mozilla binary !!!
   mozilla/widget/src/windows/nstoolkit.cpp void 
nsToolkit::Startup(HMODULE hModule)
 function return error
   it is due to WNDCLASSW registration (wc.lpszClassName    = L"nsToolkitClass";) which was already registered
   by the Mozilla running instance
=> same pb in VC8 and VC7

- integration of ODE and OgreOde : still some pbs about C/C++ callbacks
=> use dynamic_cast instead of simple C++ cast (OgreFrameListener to CollisionListener)

- main modeler panel added and available with F9

- update Navi with demo on contextual menu + lua

- Navigator ActiveX added
=> it s working in Release config
=> still problems on Navi update() grabBrowser in Debug config
=> Mozilla Plugin is working with Navigator.dll (NavigatorModule) in Release config but fails on 1st Navi (onPageLoaded callback not triggered)

- IE ActiveX & Mozilla Plugin to run Navigator from IE/Mozilla added

- Solipsis namespace added

- integration of ODE and OgreOde : pb about cubes diving into collision mesh was SIMPLY due
to the mesh' normals direction ! Flip them resolved it.
- integration of ODE and OgreOde : collisions avatar vs walls too close => due to normals pb

- integration of Ageia PhysX
- integration of Tokamak

- new scale (unit=1 meter) applied into media contents, temporary avatars' positions and physics engines
- doxygen added

- NavigatorModule added and now shared by 3 application types
- doxygen on NaviagtorModule added + 2 classes are doxygen compliants

- in plugin configs, mouse capture added (first person movement)

- pb with Ageia PhysX character controller (diving into the floor) fixed, it was due to SKIN_WIDTH < 0.1

- Fix post build compilation : tokamakd.dll and OgreOde_Core_d.dll are not copied in the runtime directory
=> in navigatorModule, only ODE plugin is embedded into VC solution, compiled and copied in post-build

- Fix bug after clean : missing Ogre DirectX renderer plugin in runtime dir
=> check you ve rebuilt fully the navigatorModule (post-build evts performed)

[Navigator]
- when using graphics cards with TEXTURE_POW2 caps, Navi can use textures non-POW2 but is unable to
  work with mask image non-POW2, texture is created on 1st POW2 size but not mask image
  exception : 
   Mask dimensions must be greater than or equal to the dimensions of the Navi's internal texture.
   Mask Dimensions: 400x300, Texture Dimensions: 512x512

- VNCPlugin : kbd events OK but kbd mapping is strange azerty vs qwerty (virtual keys to debug)
=> fixed by using getKeyboardLayout() and MapVirtualKeyEx(), still some minor addons to do

- sometimes crash when quitting with 1 VLC object into libvlc_destroy(mLibVLCInstance), after some investigations:
  pb occurs with 2 simultaneous videos when destroying 2nd instance (only when libvlc is linked by VStudio)
=> fixed by adding Static functions in misc/unicode.c, misc/win32_specific.c called only once in libvlc.c + misc/messages.c msg_XXX() logs removed 

- VLCPlugin : add libamem_plugin to play audio with FMod in 3D

- added Progress bar for scene loading
