/// brief This is the class representing a couple of poses. The two poses of a the couple represents two opposites states. For example the first pose could be a thin noze and the second pose a big noze. The CoupleOfPoses class contains a position between these two states (a number between 0 and 1). If the position is 0, the first state, pose (or the left one because it is one the left on the screen) has a an influence 0 and the second state has an influence of 1 (see ogre poses documentations for more informations).
